# Agentic RAG Tutorial

Welcome! This repository contains the companion materials for the **Agentic RAG** tutorial — a deep dive into combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with autonomous AI agents.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

This tutorial is not about plugging in frameworks — it’s about understanding the *ideas* behind:

- LLMs and their core limitations
- How traditional RAG helps mitigate them
- Lexic, Semantic, and hybrid search techniques
- The concept of AI agents
- Building Agentic RAG pipelines from scratch
- Multi-agent systems for complex tasks

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tutorial focuses on clarity over production-readiness. Expect minimal abstractions and some hand-crafted examples that are meant to teach, not scale.
